In the training of RF if I use sampling with replacement then,a row can be seleted multiple times and a row might not get selected any number of times.

There can be a row which are never selected to go into any decision trees those are called oob sample.Those rows can be used for model testing.statistically 37% rows are
oob samples.They can be used as validation set.
